Welcome to the School Donations Dashboard project! This repository contains a Tableau dashboard designed to provide comprehensive insights into school donations. The dashboard includes three key tabs: an Overview, Donations by Quarter, and School Departments and Donations. This tool helps schools track donation trends, analyze quarterly performance, and evaluate contributions by different departments.

## Features

- **Overview Tab:** Get a high-level view of total donations, overall trends, and key metrics.
- **Donations by Quarter Tab:** Analyze donations received each quarter to identify seasonal trends and patterns.
- **School Departments and Donations Tab:** Examine donations by different school departments to understand funding distribution and departmental performance.
